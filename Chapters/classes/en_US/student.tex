\chapter{Python Classes}

The built-in types, like strings have functions associated with
them. So, for example, if you needed a string converted to uppercase,
you would call it's \pyfunction{upper()} function:
-
\begin{Verbatim}
my_string = "houston, we have a problem!"
louder_string = my_string.upper()
\end{Verbatim}
This would set \pyvar{louder\_string} to "HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM!"
When a function is associated with a datatype like this, it called a
\emph{method}. A datatype with methods is known as a \emph{class}. The
data of that type is known as \emph{instance} of that class. For
example, in the example, we would say ``\pyvar{my\_string} is an instance of
the class \pytype{str}. \pytype{str} has a method called \pyfunction{upper}''

The function \pyfunction{type} will tell you the type of any data:
\begin{Verbatim}
  print(type(my_string))
\end{Verbatim}
This will output
\begin{Verbatim}
<class 'str'>
\end{Verbatim}

A class can also define operators.  \pyfunction{+}, for example, is
redefined by \pytype{str} to concatenate strings together:
\begin{Verbatim}
long_string = "I saw " + "15 people"
\end{Verbatim}

\section{Making a Polynomial class}

You have created a bunch of useful python functions for dealing with
polynomials. Notice how each one has the word ``polynomial'' in the
function name like \pyfunction{derivative\_of\_polynomial}.  Wouldn't it
be more elegant if you had a Polynomial class with a
\pyfunction{derivative} method? Then you could use your polynomial
like this:\index{class in python}
\begin{Verbatim}
a = Polynomial([9.0, 0.0, 2.3])
b = Polynomial([-2.0, 4.5, 0.0, 2.1])

print(a, "plus", b , "is", a+b)
print(a, "times", b , "is", a*b)
print(a, "times", 3 , "is", a*3)
print(a, "minus", b , "is", a-b)

c = b.derivative()

print("Derivative of", b ,"is", c)
\end{Verbatim}

And it would output:
\begin{Verbatim}
2.30x^2 + 9.00 plus 2.10x^3 + 4.50x + -2.00 is 2.10x^3 + 2.30x^2 + 4.50x + 7.00
2.30x^2 + 9.00 times 2.10x^3 + 4.50x + -2.00 is 4.83x^5 + 29.25x^3 + -4.60x^2 + 40.50x + -18.00
2.30x^2 + 9.00 times 3 is 6.90x^2 + 27.00
2.30x^2 + 9.00 minus 2.10x^3 + 4.50x + -2.00 is -2.10x^3 + 2.30x^2 + -4.50x + 11.00
Derivative of 2.10x^3 + 4.50x + -2.00 is 6.30x^2 + 4.50  
\end{Verbatim}

Create a file for your class definition called \filename{Polynomial.py}. Enter the following:
\begin{Verbatim}
class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, coeffs):
        self.coefficients = coeffs.copy()

    def __repr__(self):
        # Make a list of the monomial strings
        monomial_strings = []

        # For standard form we start at the largest degree
        degree = len(self.coefficients) - 1

        # Go through the list backwards
        while degree >= 0:
            coefficient = self.coefficients[degree]

            if coefficient != 0.0:
                # Describe the monomial
                if degree == 0:
                    monomial_string = "{:.2f}".format(coefficient)
                elif degree == 1:
                    monomial_string = "{:.2f}x".format(coefficient)
                else:
                    monomial_string = "{:.2f}x^{}".format(coefficient, degree)
                
                # Add it to the list
                monomial_strings.append(monomial_string)
        
            # Move to the previous term
            degree = degree - 1

        # Deal with the zero polynomial
        if len(monomial_strings) == 0:
            monomial_strings.append("0.0")
    
        # Separate the terms with a plus sign
        return " + ".join(monomial_strings)

    def __call__(self, x):
        sum = 0.0  
        for degree, coefficient in enumerate(self.coefficients):
            sum = sum + coefficient * x ** degree
        return sum

    def __add__(self, b):
        result_length = max(len(self.coefficients), len(b.coefficients))
        result = []
        for i in range(result_length):
            if i < len(self.coefficients):
                coefficient_a = self.coefficients[i]
            else:
                coefficient_a = 0.0

            if i < len(b.coefficients):
                coefficient_b = b.coefficients[i]
            else:
                coefficient_b = 0.0
            result.append(coefficient_a + coefficient_b)
            
        return Polynomial(result)

    def __mul__(self, other):

        # Not a polynomial?
        if not isinstance(other, Polynomial):
            # Try to make it a constant polynomial
            other = Polynomial([other])
        
        # What is the degree of the resulting polynomial?
        result_degree = (len(self.coefficients) - 1) + (len(other.coefficients) - 1)

        # Make a list of zeros to hold the coefficents
        result = [0.0] * (result_degree + 1)

        # Iterate over the indices and values of a
        for a_degree, a_coefficient in enumerate(self.coefficients):

            # Iterate over the indices and values of b
            for b_degree, b_coefficient in enumerate(other.coefficients):

                # Calculate the resulting monomial
                coefficient = a_coefficient * b_coefficient
                degree = a_degree + b_degree
            
                # Add it to the right bucket
                result[degree] = result[degree] + coefficient
            
        return Polynomial(result)

    __rmul__ = __mul__

    def __sub__(self, other):
        return self + other * -1.0
    
    def derivative(self):

        # What is the degree of the resulting polynomial?
        original_degree = len(self.coefficients) - 1
        if original_degree > 0:
            degree_of_derivative = original_degree - 1
        else:
            degree_of_derivative = 0

        # We can ignore the constant term (skip the first coefficient)
        current_degree = 1
        result = []

        while current_degree < len(self.coefficients):

            result.append(coefficient * current_degree)
            current_degree = current_degree + 1

        if len(result) == 0:
            result.append(0.0)

        return Polynomial(result)
\end{Verbatim}

Create a second file called \filename{test\_polynomial.py} to test it:
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
from Polynomial import Polynomial

a = Polynomial([9.0, 0.0, 2.3])
b = Polynomial([-2.0, 4.5, 0.0, 2.1])

print(a, "plus", b , "is", a+b)
print(a, "times", b , "is", a*b)
print(a, "times", 3 , "is", a*3)
print(a, "minus", b , "is", a-b)

c = b.derivative()

print("Derivative of", b ,"is", c)

slope = c(3)
print("Value of the derivative at 3 is", slope)

\end{Verbatim}

Run the test code:
\begin{Verbatim}
python3 test_polynomial.py
\end{Verbatim}
