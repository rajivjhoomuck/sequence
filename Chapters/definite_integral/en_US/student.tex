\chapter{Definite Integrals}

Integrals are a fundamental concept in calculus, which are used to
calculate areas, volumes, and many other things. A definite integral
calculates the net area between the function and the x-axis over a
given interval.

\section{Definition}

The definite integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$
is defined as the limit of a Riemann sum:

\begin{equation}
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = \lim_{{n \to \infty}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \Delta x
\end{equation}

where $x_i^*$ is a sample point in the $i^{th}$ subinterval of a
partition of $[a, b]$, $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$ is the width of each
subinterval, and the limit is taken as the number of subintervals $n$
approaches infinity.
