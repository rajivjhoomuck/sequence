\chapter{Other Graph Algorithms}

Now that you are familiar with Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the
shortest path in a graph, then you're well-equipped to understand more
graph algorithms. This document will discuss two other important
algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and the Bellman-Ford algorithm.\index{depth-first search} \index{DFS}

\section{Depth-First Search}

Depth-First Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching
tree or graph data structures. DFS uses a stack (or sometimes
recursion which uses the system stack implicitly) to explore the graph
in a depthward motion until it hits a node with no unvisited adjacent
nodes, then it backtracks.

The procedure is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Push the root node into the stack.
    \item Pop a node from the stack, and mark it as visited.
    \item Push all unvisited adjacent nodes into the stack.
    \item Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.
\end{enumerate}

DFS is particularly useful for solving problems such as
connected-component detection in graphs and maze-solving.

\section{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is another shortest path algorithm like
Dijkstra's. However, unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford can
handle graphs with negative weight edges.\index{Bellman-Ford algorithm}

The algorithm works as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assign a tentative distance value for every node: set it to
      zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.
    \item For each edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w$, if the current
      distance to $v$ is greater than the distance to $u$ plus $w$,
      update the distance to $v$ to be the distance to $u$ plus $w$.
    \item Repeat the previous step $|V| - 1$ times, where $|V|$ is the
      number of vertices in the graph.
    \item After the above steps, if you can still find a shorter path,
      there exists a negative cycle.
\end{enumerate}

If the graph does not contain a negative cycle reachable from the
source, the shortest paths are well-defined, and Bellman-Ford will
correctly calculate them. If a negative cycle is reachable, no
solution exists, but Bellman-Ford will detect it.
