\chapter{Evaluating the Fit of a Linear Regression Model}

The fit of a linear regression model can be evaluated using several
statistical metrics. Three common ones include the residuals, the
coefficient of determination (R-squared or $R^2$), and the root mean
squared error (RMSE).

\section{Residuals}

Residuals are the differences between the observed and predicted
values. For an observation $i$, the residual $e_i$ is calculated as\index{residual}

\[
e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\]

where $y_i$ is the observed value and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted
value. By plotting these residuals against the predicted values, we
can visually inspect the model's fit. Ideally, the residuals should be
randomly scattered around zero, and there should be no clear pattern
in the residual plot.

\section{R-Squared ($R^2$)}

R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of
the variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the
independent variables. It provides a measure of how well the model's
predictions fit the data. $R^2$ is calculated as \index{$R^2$}

\[
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}
\]

where $SS_{res}$ is the sum of squares of residuals and $SS_{tot}$ is
the total sum of squares. An $R^2$ value of 1 indicates a perfect fit,
while an $R^2$ of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of
the variability of the response data around its mean.

\section{Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)}

RMSE is a frequently used measure of the differences between the
values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. It's the
square root of the average of squared differences between prediction
and actual observation. RMSE is calculated as \index{RMSE} \index{Root
  Mean Squared Error}

\[
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]

A lower RMSE indicates a better fit to the data.

It's important to note that these metrics should not be used in
isolation to evaluate the model's fit. They should be used in
combination along with the understanding of the underlying problem and
domain knowledge.
