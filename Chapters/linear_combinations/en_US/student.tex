\chapter{Linear Combinations}

A linear combination of vectors involves combining vectors using
scalar multiplication and addition. Given vectors $\mathbf{v}_1,
\mathbf{v}_2, ..., \mathbf{v}_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and scalars $a_1,
a_2, ..., a_n \in \mathbb{R}$, a linear combination of these vectors
is any vector of the form\index{linear combonations}

\[
\mathbf{w} = a_1\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2\mathbf{v}_2 + ... + a_n\mathbf{v}_n
\]

Each scalar $a_i$ scales the corresponding vector $\mathbf{v}_i$, and
the results are added together to produce a new vector $\mathbf{w}$.

\section{Weighted Averages of Vectors}

A weighted average of vectors is a specific type of linear combination
where the coefficients (or weights) $a_i$ are non-negative and sum to
1:\index{weighted averages}

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i = 1, \quad a_i \geq 0
\]

A weighted average of vectors $\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, ...,
\mathbf{v}_n$ is then defined as

\[
\mathbf{w} = a_1\mathbf{v}_1 + a_2\mathbf{v}_2 + ... + a_n\mathbf{v}_n
\]

In this case, each $a_i$ not only scales the corresponding vector
$\mathbf{v}_i$, but also represents the proportion of that vector in
the final average vector $\mathbf{w}$.
