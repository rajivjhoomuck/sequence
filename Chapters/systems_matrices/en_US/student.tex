\chapter{Matrices}

In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. The individual numbers in the matrix are called its elements or entries. Matrices have a wide variety of applications in various fields, such as physics, computer science, engineering, and economics. They are a fundamental tool in linear algebra and help in solving systems of linear equations.

\section{Defining a Matrix}
A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called an $m \times n$ matrix or simply an $m$-by-$n$ matrix, and $m$ and $n$ are called its dimensions.

The general form of a $2 \times 3$ matrix $A$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\section{Types of Matrices}

There are several specific types of matrices.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Row Matrix:} A matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row.
\item \textbf{Column Matrix:} A matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column.
\item \textbf{Square Matrix:} A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns.
\item \textbf{Zero Matrix:} A zero matrix or null matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are zero.
\item \textbf{Identity Matrix:} The identity matrix, or sometimes called the unit matrix, of size $n$ is the $n \times n$ square matrix with 1 on the diagonals and zero everywhere else.
\end{itemize}
